        //corresponding character that does not match in the same location,
        //the percentage of corresponding characters should be returned.
        //For example, if the reference and input have 10 letters and the input
        //matches 8 of the corresponding reference characters, the function 
        //should return 80. When input does not have the same number of
        //characters as the reference, the accuracy should represent the percent
        //of matching characters between the shorter and longer strings. For
        //example, if one string has 8 characters matching the corresponding
        //locations in another string that has 16 characters, the accuracy is 50.
